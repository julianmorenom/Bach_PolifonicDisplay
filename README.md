# Bach_PolifonicDisplay
This is a data visualization project. The intent is to be able to see the polyphonic arrangement of some extent of the ouvre of Johan Sebastian Bach in expressed in LED's sequences

# The Idea
This is an idea that came to me upon thinking about the idea of simutaniety as a tool for composition, an idea used by Charles Ives. The idea is to visualize the simutaniety in the poliphony on JS Bach ouvre. For this to work out I have design a little circuit which sckematic you can view this folder. The idea is to put up all these pieces (each one in a diferent chip) and view all the pieces "play" simultaneously.

# Code
This is assembly code for a Microchip PIC 12F509. The microchip represent a pice each. This group of code will "play" the p√≠eces that correspond to three voices poliphony (BWV 787 - 801).
